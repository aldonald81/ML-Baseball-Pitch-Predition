# Predicting the type of pitch thrown in a baseball game

We aim to predict baseball pitch types based
on the pitchâ€™s speed, spin profile, and movement. We implement a K-nearest neighbors model, a support vector machine model, and a decision tree model. The KNN model performed with an average 0.855 F1 score and the SVM model
had a 0.849 F1 score average. The decision tree model performed a bit worse with an 0.820 F1 score. Splitters and
cutters performed the worst out of all pitch types in both
the SVM model and the KNN model. 4-Seam fastballs performed the best in both models.
